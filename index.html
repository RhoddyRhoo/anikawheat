        <p>Archive West. A vision in progress. A Game Design Document for an original narrative-driven adventure game set in a
        retro-futuristic world. This project began as a collaborative university assignment, where I spearheaded the core concept,
        lore, and mechanics. Though currently in the design phase, Archive West reflects my passion for immersive storytelling,
        environmental worldbuilding, and systemic gameplay - a project I hope to develop further in the future. 2023</p>

        <div class="introduction">
            <p>As a current student at Edith Cowan University, I have developed a passion for creating user-focused digital
                experiences that blend form and function. While I am still early in my professional career, I have already
                built this very portfolio website and I am eager to apply and expand my skills in a collaborative, fast-
                paced environment. I have hands-on experience in 3D modelling and foundational skills in coding (HTML/CSS).
            </p>
            
            <p>As someone with an interest in Games and interactive design, my vision is to create digital experiences
        that engage, empower and inspire users. Whether it's a portfolio website or an interactive interface, I aim to
        design with intention, prioritising usability, accessability and immersiveness. Web development has helped me sharpen
        these skills and given me a strong foundation in how people interact with technology.
        
        In the long term, I hope to bring these principles into the game design space, developing games and interactive
        media that are both technically solid and emotionally impactful. I am fascinated by the overlap between responsive
        web design and user-centred game mechanics; both require an understanding of audience, pacing, feedback and flow.
        By continuing to grow as a developer now, I am building the tools I need to eventually design game experiences
        that are not only fun and beautiful, but also thoughtful and accessible to all. </p>
